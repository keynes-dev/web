  Fit the frame to the shape of the element it is drawn in, and stand the
  machine where the caller wants it inside that frame.

  The vertical half-extent is `frustum` times `zoom` whatever the shape, so the
  extra room a wide frame brings is extra ground rather than a bigger drawing —
  which is what lets the grid run the width of a section with the machine at one
  end — and `zoom` is what keeps a tall frame from meaning a tall machine.

  `x` and `y` are where the machine lands, in fractions of a half-frame from the
  centre: 0 is centred, 1 would be hard against the edge, positive is right and
  up. Sliding the window the other way moves what is drawn in it by the same
  amount, so the camera itself never moves and every silhouette drawn against it
  still holds.
